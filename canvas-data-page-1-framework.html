<h2>Understanding Data: The Data Transformation Framework</h2>

<p>Every modern business interaction generates dataâ€”customer clicks, transaction records, sensor readings, social media mentions, operational metrics. However, data alone provides no competitive advantage. Most organizations collect vast amounts of information but struggle to transform it into actionable business insights that drive strategic advantage.</p>

<p>The transformation of raw information into competitive intelligence requires a systematic approach. Companies that master this create sustainable advantages because they make better decisions faster. The key isn't more dataâ€”it's better processes for extracting value from the data you already collect.</p>

<h3>The Executive's 6-Step Data Science Framework</h3>
<p>This framework gives executives a roadmap for turning organizational data into strategic advantage. Explore the steps, roles, and time horizons below.</p>

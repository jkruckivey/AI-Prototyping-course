Now let's look at another model called Support Vector Machines or SVMs.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:12,740
This is a machine learning algorithm that includes a learning step and was originally designed for classification tasks,

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,050
but can also be used for regression.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:25,130
The core concept of SDM is to draw a decision boundary between data points in the training set so that when a new unseen data point arrives,

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,110
it can be classified accurately.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:34,910
For example, if you're trying to classify animals by their weight and nose length to determine whether they're cats or elephants,

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,010
you have a two dimensional problem. The simplest SVM creates a line to separate cats from elephants during training.

8
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,410
SVM maximizes the margin the space between the outermost points of each class.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,620
These outermost points are called support vectors.

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:59,450
The loss function used during SVM training focuses on maximizing this margin, making it an optimization problem.

11
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,420
SVM doesn't only create linear boundaries, it can also create nonlinear boundaries,

12
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,490
such as circular ones, to separate classes that can't be divided by a straight line.

13
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,910
For example, when separating apples and oranges by weight and color, a line may not work well,

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,350
but an SVM can create a circular decision boundary to separate them to create these curved boundaries.

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:33,770
SVM uses kernel functions. This allows it to handle complex nonlinear decision boundaries and makes it useful for regression tasks as well.

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,230
In summary, SVM can fit decision boundaries as lines, polynomials, circles, or other functions.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,190
It's a simple yet powerful classifier and regression mechanism.

18
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,870
Additionally, like linear regression, logistic regression, and kohonen,

19
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:58,690
SVM is computationally efficient and doesn't require extensive resources while still providing strong classification and regression capabilities.

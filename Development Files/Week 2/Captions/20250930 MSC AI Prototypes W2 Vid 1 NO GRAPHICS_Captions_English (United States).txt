This week we are discussing supervised learning.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,920
Specifically classification and regression.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,530
We will also cover model evaluations and the learning process.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,360
To recap, machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on models or algorithms

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,600
that learn from data and generalize to unseen data without explicit instructions.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,340
In supervised learning, we use a data set containing variables known as features.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,210
These are the columns in a data set along with a dependent variable, also called the target or output.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,040
Typically, you have a table listing features with one column as the target or class the value to predict.

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,290
When we talk about features. They are also referred to as attributes.

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,180
Each column represents a feature using a training algorithm.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,110
We learn to predict the output from the inputs or features.

12
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,480
Essentially, we learn a function that maps feature columns to the target.

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:17,060
In classification, we predict a category. For instance, we might predict whether an image is of a dog or a cat.

14
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,570
Another example is predicting a person's eye color.

15
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,610
There are many applications where the target is discrete and categorical.

16
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,050
In such cases, there are a limited number of categories.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,840
When the target is a continuous numeric value, the task is called regression.

18
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,680
In regression, we learn a function that takes inputs and predicts a number.

19
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:52,460
For example, predicting a house price based on square footage, neighborhood age, and other features is a regression task.

20
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,260
The target is a numeric value, not a categorical label.

21
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,800
To summarize, classification predicts a discrete categorical value or label.

22
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,580
Regression predicts a continuous numeric value.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,600
We will now discuss foundational machine learning models.

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,850
This serves as a recap since this content was introduced in the first week.

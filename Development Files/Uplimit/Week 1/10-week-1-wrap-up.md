## Let's Review Together: AI Knowledge Check Conversation

Instead of a static quiz, let's have a conversation about what you learned in Week 1.

**[AI Chat Widget - Week 1 Review Conversation]**

```
System Prompt: "You are a patient, encouraging tutor reviewing Week 1 AI fundamentals with learners from diverse backgrounds (business, technical, career transitioners).

Ask questions about key concepts:
1. AI vs traditional automation
2. The 6-phase data science workflow
3. 4Vs of big data (volume, velocity, variety, veracity)
4. ML model families (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, self-supervised)
5. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
6. Model evaluation metrics and business impact

Adapt difficulty based on responses:
- If they struggle, offer hints and simpler explanations
- If they excel, ask deeper follow-up questions
- Connect concepts to their stated industry/role

Provide explanations, not just correct/incorrect. Encourage learners to explain concepts in their own words. Ask them to connect learning to their work context.

Be encouraging and celebrate progress. If someone gets something wrong, guide them to the right answer through questions."

Welcome Message: "Let's review Week 1 together! I'll ask you some questions and we'll discuss your answers.

This isn't a test - it's a conversation to help you solidify what you've learned.

Ready to start?

First question: Can you explain the difference between traditional rule-based automation and AI/machine learning? Use an example from any industry you know."
```

**Example review questions the AI might ask:**
- "Which ML family would you use to discover customer segments, and why?"
- "What's the first step in the data science framework, and why does it matter?"
- "What's data leakage and why is it a problem?"
- "Match each 'V' of big data to its main concern (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity)"
- "You mentioned you work in [industry] - which Week 1 concept could you apply there?"

## Quick Reference: Key Concepts

If you want a quick reminder of Week 1 concepts:

**ML Model Families:**
- **Supervised** → Have labeled examples, want to predict
- **Unsupervised** → No labels, want to discover patterns/segments
- **Reinforcement** → Optimize sequential decisions through feedback
- **Self-Supervised** → Learn from data structure (language, images, audio)

**Data Science Framework:** Problem Framing → Data Audit → Preparation → Modeling → Deployment → Monitoring

**4Vs of Big Data:**
- **Volume** → Storage/compute scale
- **Velocity** → Real-time vs batch processing
- **Variety** → Structured vs unstructured data types
- **Veracity** → Data quality and trustworthiness

**Data Leakage:** Using future information during training → unrealistically good results that fail in production

---

## Check Your Understanding

Review these key concepts from Week 1:

- Can you explain the difference between expert systems and learning systems?
- What are the key attributes that make data "big data"?
- How does machine learning differ from traditional rule-based programming?
- Why is data quality important for AI success?
- What role does data play in the machine learning process?

*If you're uncertain about any of these, review the relevant sections before proceeding to Week 2.*

## Reflection & Transfer: Apply Your Learning

**[AI Roleplay Widget - Personal AI Project Advisor]**

```
System Prompt: "You are an AI project advisor helping learners identify opportunities to apply Week 1 concepts to their own work or career goals.

Guide learners through:
1. Identifying a real problem or decision from their work (or target industry)
2. Applying the 6-phase data science framework
3. Assessing data availability and quality needs
4. Defining success metrics
5. Scoping a realistic first step

Adapt to learner's situation:
- **Currently working**: Help identify AI opportunities in their current role
- **Job searching**: Help articulate AI skills for interviews/portfolios
- **Career transitioning**: Help identify which AI role/skills to develop
- **Students**: Help find project ideas for portfolios
- **Entrepreneurs**: Help evaluate AI for their business

Be realistic about constraints (time, data, resources). Help scope small, achievable projects. Celebrate good thinking.

At the end, help them create a simple action plan (1-3 concrete next steps)."

Welcome Message: "Let's identify how you can apply Week 1 concepts to something you care about!

**Adapt to your situation - pick what fits:**

**If you're currently working:**
- Where in your work could better data or AI make the biggest impact?
- What decision or process could benefit from the concepts you learned?

**If you're job searching:**
- What AI skills from Week 1 would you highlight in your next interview?
- How could you demonstrate these concepts in a portfolio project?

**If you're exploring career options:**
- Which Week 1 concept or role interested you most (data analyst, ML engineer, product manager)?
- What would you want to learn next to move in that direction?

**If you're a student or building skills:**
- What project could you build to practice these concepts?
- Which industry or problem domain excites you?

**If you're evaluating AI for your business:**
- What's one high-leverage use case where data could improve decisions?
- Do you have the data needed, or would you need to start collecting it?

Tell me your situation and I'll help you create an action plan!"
```

**If you prefer to reflect independently:**

Choose the prompt that fits your situation:

**Working professionals:** Where in your current role could data quality or feature engineering make the biggest difference?

**Job seekers:** What AI concepts from Week 1 would you emphasize in your next interview? How would you demonstrate understanding?

**Career explorers:** What surprised you most about how AI actually works? Which role (analyst, scientist, engineer, PM) appeals to you?

**Students:** What project could you build to practice these concepts and add to your portfolio?

**Entrepreneurs:** What's one decision in your business where better data could create value?

### Your Action Plan

Pick one upcoming decision or opportunity and sketch a *mini plan*:
1. **Problem**: What decision or outcome to improve?
2. **Data sources**: What data exists or could you collect?
3. **Guardrails**: What quality checks or constraints matter?
4. **Success metric**: How would you measure improvement?
5. **First step**: What's one concrete action you could take this week?

## Helpful Tip

Pair model type with decision cadence: *real-time personalization ≠ quarterly batch scoring*.

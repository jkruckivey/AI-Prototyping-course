# Module 1 — Review & Wrap-Up

## Video: Completing the Data Science Cycle

**Video Embed**: 20250922 MSC Week 1 Vid 11 - Completing the Data Science Cycle
- **Platform**: Panopto
- **Duration**: Approximately 6-8 minutes
- **Topics**: Deployment, model selection, training/testing data, evaluation metrics, AI building blocks summary

---

## Quick Recap

This module covered: **AI in business**, the **data science framework**, **Big Data 4Vs**, **ML model families**, **preprocessing**, and **evaluation basics**.

---

## Knowledge Check

### 1) Which ML type fits discovering customer segments?

A. Supervised
**B. Unsupervised** ✓
C. Reinforcement
D. Self-Supervised

*Why*: You don't have labels; you're discovering structure.

---

### 2) First step in the data science framework?

**Problem framing** ✓ — Clarify the decision, KPI, constraints, and success criteria.

---

### 3) What's the risk of using future information during training?

**Leakage** ✓ — Your model looks unrealistically good and fails in production.

---

### 4) Match each 'V' to its concern

- **Volume** → storage/compute strategies
- **Velocity** → ingestion/streaming cadence
- **Variety** → structured vs. unstructured integration
- **Veracity** → data quality & trust

---

## Check Your Understanding

Review these key concepts from Week 1:

- Can you explain the difference between expert systems and learning systems?
- What are the key attributes that make data "big data"?
- How does machine learning differ from traditional rule-based programming?
- Why is data quality important for AI success?
- What role does data play in the machine learning process?

*If you're uncertain about any of these, review the relevant sections before proceeding to Week 2.*

## Reflection & Transfer

### Prompt

Where in your work could **data quality** or **feature engineering** make the biggest difference? Write 3–5 sentences or a short bullet list.

---

### Action idea

Pick one upcoming decision and sketch a *mini plan*: data sources, guardrails, and success metric you'd monitor.

---

## Helpful Tip

Pair model type with decision cadence: *real-time personalization ≠ quarterly batch scoring*.

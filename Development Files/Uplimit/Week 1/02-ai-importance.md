## AI: Concepts, Context, and Fit

### What is AI (vs. traditional automation)?

**AI** refers to systems that learn patterns from data and improve with experience. Traditional automation follows explicit, hand-written rules.

| Aspect | Rule-based Automation | AI / Machine Learning |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| How it works | IF/THEN rules crafted by experts | Models learn patterns from examples |
| When to use | Stable logic, few exceptions | Complex patterns, variability, ambiguity |
| Maintenance | Change rules manually | Retrain with new data; monitor drift |

### Why AI, why now? (data, compute, algorithms)

**Data**: Digital processes emit rich behavioural signals (transactions, clicks, text, images) at scale.

**Compute**: Cloud & accelerators make training and serving advanced models economical.

**Algorithms**: Advances in deep learning and representation learning unlock language, vision, and audio.

### Where AI fits in work (automation, assistance, augmentation)

**Automation** — routine tasks (routing, classification) executed consistently at scale.

**Assistance** — copilots for drafting, summarizing, and retrieval.

**Augmentation** — decision support: forecasts, risk scores, next-best actions.

## Reflection

*Quick prompt*: Identify one decision in your team that could benefit from assistance (copilot) vs. full automation. What data would you need to trust it?

---

## Helpful Tip

Start with a small, high-leverage use case where data already exists and impact can be measured in weeks, not months.

# Understanding Data - From Raw Data to Actionable Insights

## The Foundation of AI

Data is the fuel that powers AI. This page walks the journey from *raw data → information → predictions → actions* and introduces "big data" as the scale shift that enables modern AI.

## From Raw Data to Actionable Insights: The Data Science Process

### Real-World Success Story

A supermarket chain moved from generic promos to data-driven, personalized offers. Below, explore how raw data → segments → targeted actions → measurable lift.

---

### The Business Challenge

Generic promotions underperformed and retention slipped. The team reframed the problem: *Which customers respond to what, and when?* They inventoried data sources and redesigned offers accordingly.

#### Raw Data Sources Identified

- Purchase history across all store locations and periods
- Demographic information from loyalty programs
- Seasonality patterns by product and customer type
- Time-of-day transaction data (shopping preferences)

## The Scale Shift: From Small Data to Big Data

The customer segmentation example above shows how traditional data analysis creates value. But **big data** represents a fundamental scale shift that enables modern AI capabilities.

### What Makes Data "Big"?

Big data isn't just about size—it's characterized by four critical dimensions that work together to create new possibilities for AI:

- **Volume**: Population-scale datasets instead of samples
- **Velocity**: Real-time processing and immediate responses
- **Variety**: Multiple data types and formats combined
- **Veracity**: Quality control at massive scale

### The AI Connection

Modern AI algorithms *require* big data to function effectively. Machine learning models need thousands or millions of examples to recognize patterns, while traditional analytics worked with hundreds or thousands of records.

**Next**: We'll explore each of these four dimensions in detail with interactive business examples.

### Why Scale Matters for AI Success

**Traditional Analytics** → **Sample-based insights** → **General trends**

**Big Data + AI** → **Population-scale patterns** → **Personalized predictions**

*Example*: Netflix's recommendation engine analyzes viewing patterns from 200M+ users to suggest content you'll actually want to watch, not just popular shows.

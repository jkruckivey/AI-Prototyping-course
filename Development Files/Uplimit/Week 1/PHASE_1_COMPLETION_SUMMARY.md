```
Reflection: Write 3-5 sentences about where data quality matters in your work.
```

**After (Active):**
```
[AI Roleplay Widget - Personal AI Project Advisor]
"Let's identify how you can apply Week 1 concepts to something you care about!

Adapt to your situation - pick what fits:
- If you're currently working...
- If you're job searching...
- If you're exploring career options...
- If you're a student...
- If you're evaluating AI for your business...

Tell me your situation and I'll help you create an action plan!"
```

- Encourage learner reasoning
```

**3. Industry Awareness**
```
Adapt examples to learner industry:
- Retail, Healthcare, Education, Finance, SaaS, Manufacturing, Non-profit
- Translate concepts across domains
- Provide sector-specific applications
```

**4. Encouragement & Support**
```
Be patient and encouraging:
- Celebrate good thinking and progress
- Reassure learners struggling with concepts
- Normalize diverse backgrounds
- Build confidence
```

**5. Practical Focus**
```
Connect to real-world application:

"I'm a software engineer new to ML. How does this apply to me?"
→ AI detects role, provides engineering-focused examples
→ Conversational learning adapts to technical background
→ "For Technical Learners" sections preview code labs
→ AI helps scope ML projects for engineer perspective
→ Examples span tech, SaaS, and other relevant industries

<h1>Understanding the AI Hierarchy</h1>

<p>To navigate AI strategically, you need to understand the relationship between AI, machine learning, and deep learning:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> is the broadest term, encompassing any system that exhibits intelligent behavior</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a subset of AI focused on systems that learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed for each task</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong> is a specialized form of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data patterns</li>
</ul>

  <div class="widget-instructions">
    <p><strong>ðŸ¤– Interactive AI Hierarchy Visualization</strong></p>
    <p>Rather than a static diagram, explore the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning through this interactive visualization.</p>
    <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Click on each nested circle to discover:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
      <li>Precise definitions of AI, ML, and Deep Learning</li>
      <li>Real business examples for each level</li>
      <li>How the concepts build upon each other</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Pay attention to how different business problems require different levels of AI sophistication.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Question:</strong> <em>Which level of AI would be most appropriate for a current challenge in your organization?</em></p>

<div class="learning-objective">
  <strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Students grasp the nested relationship between AI concepts and understand how to match business problems with appropriate technology levels.
</div>

<p><strong>This hierarchy matters for business leaders</strong> because different types of problems require different AI approaches. Simple automation tasks might need only basic AI, while complex pattern recognition in images or natural language might require deep learning solutions. Understanding these distinctions helps you match the right AI technology to your specific business challenges.</p>

<div class="key-concept">
  <strong>Strategic Principle:</strong> The most successful AI implementations start with clearly defined business problems and then select the appropriate level of AI sophistication needed to solve them. As we'll see throughout this course, the technology should always serve your business strategy, not the other way around.
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The key insight for business leaders is that AI isn't a single technology but a spectrum of capabilities. Different types of problems require different AI approaches. Simple automation tasks might need only basic AI, while complex pattern recognition in images or natural language might require deep learning solutions.</p>

# Linear Regression Interactive Demo

An interactive web application for teaching linear regression concepts, designed to complement AI/ML coursework.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

Students will understand:
- How linear regression finds the best-fitting line through data
- The role of parameters (slope Œ≤, intercept Œµ) in the model
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a loss function
- The optimization process that minimizes prediction errors
- Multi-dimensional regression and hyperplanes

## ‚ú® Features

### Interactive Visualization
- **Real-time parameter adjustment**: Drag sliders to change slope and intercept
- **Live MSE calculation**: See how errors change as you adjust the line
- **Error visualization**: Dotted lines show prediction errors for each data point
- **Auto-fit functionality**: Find the mathematically optimal line with one click

### Educational Components
- **Concept cards**: Click to highlight related interface elements
- **Multi-dimensional examples**: Compare 1D, 3D, and N-dimensional regression
- **Salary prediction tool**: Try multi-dimensional regression with real parameters

### Course Integration
Based on the linear regression module covering:
- Parameters vs hyperparameters
- Loss functions and optimization
- Dimensionality and hyperplanes
- Training process visualization

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Simple Setup
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Start adjusting parameters and exploring concepts
3. No installation or server required

### For Development
```bash
# Clone or download the files
# Serve with any local server for best experience
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

## üìö How to Use

### For Students
1. **Explore the basics**: Adjust slope and intercept sliders to see how they affect the line
2. **Understand errors**: Watch how MSE changes as you move the line
3. **Find the optimum**: Click "Find Best Fit" to see the algorithm in action
4. **Try multi-dimensional**: Use the prediction tool to see how multiple features work

### For Instructors
- Use as a live demo during lectures
- Assign as pre-class exploration
- Reference specific concepts by clicking concept cards
- Extend with additional datasets or features

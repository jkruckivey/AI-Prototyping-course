## üöÄ Getting Started

### Simple Setup
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Start adjusting parameters and exploring concepts
3. No installation or server required

### For Development
```bash
# Clone or download the files
# Serve with any local server for best experience
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

## üìö How to Use

### For Students
1. **Explore the basics**: Adjust slope and intercept sliders to see how they affect the line
2. **Understand errors**: Watch how MSE changes as you move the line
3. **Find the optimum**: Click "Find Best Fit" to see the algorithm in action
4. **Try multi-dimensional**: Use the prediction tool to see how multiple features work

### For Instructors
- Use as a live demo during lectures
- Assign as pre-class exploration
- Reference specific concepts by clicking concept cards
- Extend with additional datasets or features

## üîß Technical Details

### Technologies
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies

### Data
- Sample dataset: Years of experience vs salary
- 15 realistic data points for clear pattern recognition
- Multi-dimensional model with experience, education, and location factors

## üìà Educational Benefits

### Conceptual Understanding
- **Visual learning**: See math concepts in action
- **Interactive exploration**: Learn by doing, not just reading
- **Immediate feedback**: Understand cause and effect relationships

### Practical Skills
- **Parameter intuition**: Develop feel for how parameters affect models
- **Optimization awareness**: Understand the training process

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Datasets
```javascript
// In script.js, modify the data object:
this.data = {
  x: [your, x, values],
  y: [your, y, values]
};
```

### Styling
- Modify `styles.css` for visual customization
- CSS custom properties make theming easy
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes

### Extended Features

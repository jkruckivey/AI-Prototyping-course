## üìç **Widget 3: AI ROI Calculator**

### **Canvas Placement:** After "Four Pillars of AI Business Value" (Page 3)

### **Instructional Text Template:**
```
üìä **AI Business Case Calculator**

You've learned that AI delivers value through Automation, Personalization, Prediction, and Optimization. Now quantify that value using real business scenarios.

**Your Task:** Use the calculator below to explore AI's financial impact:
1. **Start with realistic numbers** from your industry or organization
2. **Experiment with different efficiency gains** (10%, 30%, 50%)
3. **Note how implementation costs affect payback periods**
4. **Observe the insights provided** for different ROI scenarios

**Business Context:** The calculator uses the same ROI methodology that consulting firms use for actual AI implementation proposals.

**Discussion Point:** *What efficiency gain percentage would you need to justify AI investment in your context?*

**Time Estimate:** 5-7 minutes of scenario testing
```

### **Learning Objectives Alignment:**
- Students quantify abstract ROI concepts with concrete numbers
- Students understand investment decision-making criteria
- Students connect AI capabilities to measurable business outcomes

## üìç **Widget 4: ROI Calculator (Executive Exercise)**

### **Canvas Placement:** During Step 3 - Impact Assessment (Page 6)

### **Instructional Text Template:**
```
üíº **Personal ROI Analysis for Your AI Opportunities**

You've identified specific AI opportunities in your organization during Steps 1-2. Now quantify their potential business impact to support your Priority Matrix creation.

**Your Task:** For each of the three AI opportunities you identified:
1. **Estimate current costs** of the problem (time, money, inefficiency)
2. **Project realistic efficiency gains** AI could deliver
3. **Research implementation costs** from industry benchmarks
4. **Calculate ROI and payback periods** for each opportunity

**Strategic Application:** Use these ROI calculations to complete Step 4's Priority Matrix. High-ROI opportunities with reasonable payback periods should rank higher in feasibility.

**Pro Tip:** Be conservative with efficiency estimates‚Äîit's better to under-promise and over-deliver in AI implementations.

**Expected Outcome:** Data-driven prioritization of your organization's AI opportunities
```

### **Learning Objectives Alignment:**
- Students apply theoretical ROI concepts to personal business context
- Students create evidence-based AI implementation priorities  
- Students develop realistic expectations for AI project outcomes

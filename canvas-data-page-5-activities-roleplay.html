            <p><strong>Dr. Sarah Chen, AI Strategy Consultant, addresses the executive team</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for gathering for what I believe will be a pivotal strategic session for MidMarket Manufacturing. As you know, the board has entrusted us with developing an AI implementation strategy that will position the company competitively while delivering measurable returns on our $2.5 million investment.</p>
                <p>The urgency is real. Over the past 24 months, we've seen market share decline by 12% as competitors leverage AI for operational optimization, predictive maintenance, and enhanced customer experiences. Our manufacturing costs remain 18% higher than AI-enabled competitors, and key clients are now requesting AI-powered capabilities as contract renewal conditions.</p>
                <p>However, we also have significant advantages: 15 years of operational data, strong customer relationships, domain expertise, and a workforce ready to embrace technology that makes their jobs more effective. The question isn't whether we should invest in AI—it's how to invest strategically for maximum impact.</p>
                <p>Today, we'll work through a systematic evaluation of AI opportunities across all functional areas. I'll facilitate our discussion, but the decisions rest with you as the leadership team. We have competing priorities, limited resources, and an 18-month timeline to show measurable results.</p>
                <p>Let's begin with each of you sharing your perspective on our most critical business challenges and where you see AI creating the greatest impact for your functional area. Remember, we're not just choosing technology—we're making strategic bets on the company's future.</p>
                <p>Who would like to start?"</p>

        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title dp-ignore-theme">AI Business Case Builder Objective</h5>
            <p>Create a compelling, data-driven business case for AI adoption that executives can apply directly to their organizations. This activity gives participants firsthand experience building a simple AI system using Google's Teachable Machine and translating that experience into ROI-focused strategy.</p>
            <p>Executives often understand AI conceptually but struggle to turn that into actionable business cases. By experimenting with AI model training and testing, participants gain insight into data requirements, performance limitations, and business value — bridging the gap between theory and application.</p>
